# Parity-Bot
A Discord/Slack message parity system

This bot system is designed to be hosted on one server.
It can copy messages (and maybe files later on) in specified channels.
A parity message will follow this simple format:
 ```[Display name / Nickname] -- [Message] -- (From [Slack / Discord])```
